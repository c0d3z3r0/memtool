Description: Development tool to modify memory mapped registers
 memtool allows one to read and write memory mapped registers via /dev/mem. The
 commands are inspired by the respective commands of the barebox bootloader.
 This is handy during driver development to inspect and modify register
 settings. It can also be used to modify regular files and character devices
 (e.g. to paint to /dev/fb0).
